### `DT-NN_classification_SalaryDataScience.ipynb`

Tabular data classification on data science salaries, involving preprocessing, deep neural network comparison, and interpretability analysis.
**Final project**, done in collaboration with **Michalis Thomas**.
*Dataset not included. Feature examples:*
`work_year	experience_level	employment_type	job_title	salary	salary_currency	salary_in_usd	employee_residence	remote_ratio	company_location	company_size.`

See `DT-NN_report.pdf` for project objectives, methodology, and conclusions.
